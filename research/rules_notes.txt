there are 72 land tiles, in a stack

one tile is the diesgnated start tile 

there are 40 meeples
- there are 8 of each yellow, red, green, blue, and black
- each player starts with 7 meeples
- each player uses their 1 remaining meeple to mark their score on the board

on a player's turn...
- must draw 1 land tile from the stack and place it in the landscape
- the landscape must be continued
- may place a meeple onto the tile just placed
- score any features completed by the tile placement

placing meeples:
- a meeple may be placed on a road segment if the road is unoccupied by another. it's called a 
  highwayman
- a meeple may be placed on a city section if the city is unoccupied by another. its called a 
  knight
- after a feature is scored, any meeple is removed

features:
- a road is considered completed when all nodes are connected to a city/monastery/village, or
  when it loops onto itself
- a road is worth 1 point per tile
- a city is considered completed when it is surrounded by walls and there are no internal gaps
- a city is worth 2 point per tile + 2 points per coat of arms
- a monastery is considered completed when it is surrounded by tiles
- a monastery is worth 1 point per tile surrounding it including the monastery, so 9 points

if a feature has multiple meeples, the player with the most meeples gets the points. if its a tie,
both players get the points

end of game:
- each incomplete road is worth one point per tile
- each incomplete city is worth 1 point per tile, and 1 point per coat of arms
- each incomplete monastery is worth one point per surrounding tile
